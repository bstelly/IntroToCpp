#include <iostream>

//1. Create a function for each of the following math operators. They must return a value. 
//	 and take in at least two argument. Once all the functions have been created you will need to 
//	 invoke them and print out the return.
	//a. Addition
	//b. Subtraction
	//c. Multliplication
	//d. Division
int Add(int a, int b)
{
	int result = a + b;
	return result;
}

int Subtraction(int a, int b)
{
	int result = a - b;
	return result;
}

int Multiplication(int a, int b)
{
	int result = a * b;
	return result;
}

int Division(int a, int b)
{
	int result = a / b;
	return result;
}

//2. Create a function that takes in two arguments, one being an array of float and the other
//   being the size of the array. It must return the largest value in the array.



//3. Using recursion write a function that prints out the Fibonacci sequence.


//4. The following statement calls a function named Half. The Half function returns a value that 
//   is half that of the argument. Write the function.


//5. Write a function that takes as its parameters an array of intergers and the size of the array
//   and returns the sum of the values in the array.
