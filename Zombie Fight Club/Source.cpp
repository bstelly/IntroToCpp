#include <iostream>

//Create a class representing a zombie.
//- Each zombie should have health and an attack value.
//- Ensure that the zombie's variables are private and you have functions that allow us to modify the zombie data.
//- Using the zombie class, create a game where a number of zombies attack each other until only one remains.
//- You must have a written UML of the zombie class.This can be done either on paper, google draw, gliffy.
